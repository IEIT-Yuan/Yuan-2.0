# TensorRT-LLM Backend
The Triton backend for [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM).
You can learn more about Triton backends in the [backend repo](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend).
The goal of TensorRT-LLM Backend is to let you serve [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM)
models with Triton Inference Server. The [inflight_batcher_llm](./inflight_batcher_llm/)
directory contains the C++ implementation of the backend supporting inflight
batching, paged attention and more.

Where can I ask general questions about Triton and Triton backends?
Be sure to read all the information below as well as the [general
Triton documentation](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server#triton-inference-server)
available in the main [server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server)
repo. If you don't find your answer there you can ask questions on the
[issues page](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend/issues).

## Accessing the TensorRT-LLM Backend

There are several ways to access the TensorRT-LLM Backend.

**Before Triton 23.10 release, please use [Option 3 to build TensorRT-LLM backend via Docker](#option-3-build-via-docker).**

### Run the Pre-built Docker Container

Starting with Triton 23.10 release, Triton includes a container with the TensorRT-LLM
Backend and Python Backend. This container should have everything to run a
TensorRT-LLM model. You can find this container on the
[Triton NGC page](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tritonserver).

### Build the Docker Container

#### Option 1. Build via the `build.py` Script in Server Repo

Starting with Triton 23.10 release, you can follow steps described in the
[Building With Docker](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/customization_guide/build.md#building-with-docker)
guide and use the
[build.py](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/build.py)
script.

A sample command to build a Triton Server container with all options enabled is
shown below, which will build the same TRT-LLM container as the one on the NGC.

```bash
BASE_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME=nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.10-py3-min
TENSORRTLLM_BACKEND_REPO_TAG=release/0.5.0
PYTHON_BACKEND_REPO_TAG=r23.10

# Run the build script. The flags for some features or endpoints can be removed if not needed.
./build.py -v --no-container-interactive --enable-logging --enable-stats --enable-tracing \
              --enable-metrics --enable-gpu-metrics --enable-cpu-metrics \
              --filesystem=gcs --filesystem=s3 --filesystem=azure_storage \
              --endpoint=http --endpoint=grpc --endpoint=sagemaker --endpoint=vertex-ai \
              --backend=ensemble --enable-gpu --endpoint=http --endpoint=grpc \
              --image=base,${BASE_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME} \
              --backend=tensorrtllm:${TENSORRTLLM_BACKEND_REPO_TAG} \
              --backend=python:${PYTHON_BACKEND_REPO_TAG}
```

The `BASE_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME` is the base image that will be used to build the
container. By default it is set to the most recent min image of Triton, on NGC,
that matches the Triton release you are building for. You can change it to a
different image if needed by setting the `--image` flag like the command below.
The `TENSORRTLLM_BACKEND_REPO_TAG` and `PYTHON_BACKEND_REPO_TAG` are the tags of
the TensorRT-LLM backend and Python backend repositories that will be used
to build the container. You can also remove the features or endpoints that you
don't need by removing the corresponding flags.

#### Option 2. Build via Docker

The version of Triton Server used in this build option can be found in the
[Dockerfile](./dockerfile/Dockerfile.trt_llm_backend).

```bash
# Update the submodules
cd tensorrtllm_backend
git lfs install
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Use the Dockerfile to build the backend in a container
# For x86_64
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t triton_trt_llm -f dockerfile/Dockerfile.trt_llm_backend .
# For aarch64
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t triton_trt_llm --build-arg TORCH_INSTALL_TYPE="src_non_cxx11_abi" -f dockerfile/Dockerfile.trt_llm_backend .
```

## Using the TensorRT-LLM Backend

Below is an example of how to serve a TensorRT-LLM model with the Triton
TensorRT-LLM Backend on a 4-GPU environment. The example uses the GPT model from
the [TensorRT-LLM repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main/examples/gpt).

### Prepare TensorRT-LLM engines

You can skip this step if you already have the engines ready.
Follow the [guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main/examples/gpt) in
TensorRT-LLM repository for more details on how to to prepare the engines for deployment.

```bash
# Update the submodule TensorRT-LLM repository
git submodule update --init --recursive
git lfs install
git lfs pull

# TensorRT-LLM is required for generating engines. You can skip this step if
# you already have the package installed. If you are generating engines within
# the Triton container, you have to install the TRT-LLM package.
(cd tensorrt_llm &&
    bash docker/common/install_cmake.sh &&
    export PATH=/usr/local/cmake/bin:$PATH &&
    python3 ./scripts/build_wheel.py --trt_root="/usr/local/tensorrt" &&
    pip3 install ./build/tensorrt_llm*.whl)

# Go to the tensorrt_llm/examples/gpt directory
cd tensorrt_llm/examples/gpt

# Download weights from HuggingFace Transformers
rm -rf gpt2 && git clone https://huggingface.co/gpt2-medium gpt2
pushd gpt2 && rm pytorch_model.bin model.safetensors && wget -q https://huggingface.co/gpt2-medium/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin && popd

# Convert weights from HF Tranformers to FT format
python3 hf_gpt_convert.py -p 8 -i gpt2 -o ./c-model/gpt2 --tensor-parallelism 4 --storage-type float16

# Build TensorRT engines
python3 build.py --model_dir=./c-model/gpt2/4-gpu/ \
                 --world_size=4 \
                 --dtype float16 \
                 --use_inflight_batching \
                 --use_gpt_attention_plugin float16 \
                 --paged_kv_cache \
                 --use_gemm_plugin float16 \
                 --remove_input_padding \
                 --use_layernorm_plugin float16 \
                 --hidden_act gelu \
                 --parallel_build \
                 --output_dir=engines/fp16/4-gpu
```

### Create the model repository

There are five models in the [`all_models/inflight_batcher_llm`](./all_models/inflight_batcher_llm/)
directory that will be used in this example:
- "preprocessing": This model is used for tokenizing, meaning the conversion from
prompts(string) to input_ids(list of ints).
- "tensorrt_llm": This model is a wrapper of your TensorRT-LLM model and is used
for inferencing
- "postprocessing": This model is used for de-tokenizing, meaning the conversion
from output_ids(list of ints) to outputs(string).
- "ensemble": This model can be used to chain the preprocessing, tensorrt_llm
and postprocessing models together.
- "tensorrt_llm_bls": This model can also be used to chain the preprocessing,
tensorrt_llm and postprocessing models together. The BLS model has an optional
parameter `accumulate_tokens` which can be used in streaming mode to call the
preprocessing model with all accumulated tokens, instead of only one token.
This might be necessary for certain tokenizers.

To learn more about ensemble and BLS models, please see the
[Ensemble Models](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/user_guide/architecture.md#ensemble-models)
and [Business Logic Scripting](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend#business-logic-scripting)
sections of the Triton Inference Server documentation.

```bash
# Create the model repository that will be used by the Triton server
cd tensorrtllm_backend
mkdir triton_model_repo

# Copy the example models to the model repository
cp -r all_models/inflight_batcher_llm/* triton_model_repo/

# Copy the TRT engine to triton_model_repo/tensorrt_llm/1/
cp tensorrt_llm/examples/gpt/engines/fp16/4-gpu/* triton_model_repo/tensorrt_llm/1
```

### Modify the model configuration
The following table shows the fields that may to be modified before deployment:

*triton_model_repo/preprocessing/config.pbtxt*

| Name | Description
| :----------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| `tokenizer_dir` | The path to the tokenizer for the model. In this example, the path should be set to `/tensorrtllm_backend/tensorrt_llm/examples/gpt/gpt2` as the tensorrtllm_backend directory will be mounted to `/tensorrtllm_backend` within the container |
| `tokenizer_type` | The type of the tokenizer for the model, `t5`, `auto` and `llama` are supported. In this example, the type should be set to `auto` |

*triton_model_repo/tensorrt_llm/config.pbtxt*

| Name | Description
| :----------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| `gpt_model_type` | Mandatory. Set to `inflight_fused_batching` when enabling in-flight batching support. To disable in-flight batching, set to `V1` |
| `gpt_model_path` | Mandatory. Path to the TensorRT-LLM engines for deployment. In this example, the path should be set to `/tensorrtllm_backend/triton_model_repo/tensorrt_llm/1` as the tensorrtllm_backend directory will be mounted to `/tensorrtllm_backend` within the container |
| `batch_scheduler_policy` | Mandatory. Set to `max_utilization` to greedily pack as many requests as possible in each current in-flight batching iteration. This maximizes the throughput but may result in overheads due to request pause/resume if KV cache limits are reached during execution. Set to `guaranteed_no_evict` to guarantee that a started request is never paused.|
| `decoupled` | Optional (default=`false`). Controls streaming. Decoupled mode must be set to `True` if using the streaming option from the client. |
| `max_beam_width` | Optional (default=1). The maximum beam width that any request may ask for when using beam search.|
| `max_tokens_in_paged_kv_cache` | Optional (default=unspecified). The maximum size of the KV cache in number of tokens. If unspecified, value is interpreted as 'infinite'. KV cache allocation is the min of max_tokens_in_paged_kv_cache and value derived from kv_cache_free_gpu_mem_fraction below. |
| `max_attention_window_size` | Optional (default=max_sequence_length). When using techniques like sliding window attention, the maximum number of tokens that are attended to generate one token. Defaults attends to all tokens in sequence. |
| `kv_cache_free_gpu_mem_fraction` | Optional (default=0.9). Set to a number between 0 and 1 to indicate the maximum fraction of GPU memory (after loading the model) that may be used for KV cache.|
| `max_num_sequences` | Optional (default=`max_batch_size` if `enable_trt_overlap` is `false` and to `2 * max_batch_size` if `enable_trt_overlap` is `true`, where `max_batch_size` is the TRT engine maximum batch size). Maximum number of sequences that the in-flight batching scheme can maintain state for.
| `enable_trt_overlap` | Optional (default=`true`). Set to `true` to partition available requests into 2 'microbatches' that can be run concurrently to hide exposed CPU runtime |
| `exclude_input_in_output` | Optional (default=`false`). Set to `true` to only return completion tokens in a response. Set to `false` to return the prompt tokens concatenated with the generated tokens  |
| `normalize_log_probs` | Optional (default=`true`). Set to `false` to skip normalization of `output_log_probs`  |

*triton_model_repo/postprocessing/config.pbtxt*

| Name | Description
| :----------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| `tokenizer_dir` | The path to the tokenizer for the model. In this example, the path should be set to `/tensorrtllm_backend/tensorrt_llm/examples/gpt/gpt2` as the tensorrtllm_backend directory will be mounted to `/tensorrtllm_backend` within the container |
| `tokenizer_type` | The type of the tokenizer for the model, `t5`, `auto` and `llama` are supported. In this example, the type should be set to `auto` |

### Launch Triton server

Please follow the option corresponding to the way you build the TensorRT-LLM backend.

#### Option 1. Launch Triton server *within Triton NGC container*

```bash
docker run --rm -it --net host --shm-size=2g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --gpus all -v /path/to/tensorrtllm_backend:/tensorrtllm_backend nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.10-trtllm-python-py3 bash
```

#### Option 2. Launch Triton server *within the Triton container built via build.py script*

```bash
docker run --rm -it --net host --shm-size=2g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --gpus all -v /path/to/tensorrtllm_backend:/tensorrtllm_backend tritonserver bash
```

#### Option 3. Launch Triton server *within the Triton container built via Docker*

```bash
docker run --rm -it --net host --shm-size=2g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --gpus all -v /path/to/tensorrtllm_backend:/tensorrtllm_backend triton_trt_llm bash
```

Once inside the container, you can launch the Triton server with the following command:

```bash
cd /tensorrtllm_backend
# --world_size is the number of GPUs you want to use for serving
python3 scripts/launch_triton_server.py --world_size=4 --model_repo=/tensorrtllm_backend/triton_model_repo
```

When successfully deployed, the server produces logs similar to the following ones.
```
I0919 14:52:10.475738 293 grpc_server.cc:2451] Started GRPCInferenceService at 0.0.0.0:8001
I0919 14:52:10.475968 293 http_server.cc:3558] Started HTTPService at 0.0.0.0:8000
I0919 14:52:10.517138 293 http_server.cc:187] Started Metrics Service at 0.0.0.0:8002
```

### Query the server with the Triton generate endpoint

Starting with Triton 23.10 release, you can query the server using Triton's
[generate endpoint](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/protocol/extension_generate.md)
with a curl command based on the following general format within your client
environment/container:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/v2/models/${MODEL_NAME}/generate -d '{"{PARAM1_KEY}": "{PARAM1_VALUE}", ... }'
```

In the case of the models used in this example, you can replace MODEL_NAME with `ensemble` or `tensorrt_llm_bls`. Examining the
`ensemble` and `tensorrt_llm_bls` model's config.pbtxt file, you can see that 4 parameters are required to generate a response
for this model:

- "text_input": Input text to generate a response from
- "max_tokens": The number of requested output tokens
- "bad_words": A list of bad words (can be empty)
- "stop_words": A list of stop words (can be empty)

Therefore, we can query the server in the following way:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/v2/models/ensemble/generate -d '{"text_input": "What is machine learning?", "max_tokens": 20, "bad_words": "", "stop_words": ""}'
```
if using the `ensemble` model or
```
curl -X POST localhost:8000/v2/models/tensorrt_llm_bls/generate -d '{"text_input": "What is machine learning?", "max_tokens": 20, "bad_words": "", "stop_words": ""}'
```
if using the `tensorrt_llm_bls` model.

Which should return a result similar to (formatted for readability):
```json
{
  "model_name": "ensemble",
  "model_version": "1",
  "sequence_end": false,
  "sequence_id": 0,
  "sequence_start": false,
  "text_output": "What is machine learning?\n\nMachine learning is a method of learning by using machine learning algorithms to solve problems.\n\n"
}
```

### Utilize the provided client script to send a request

You can send requests to the "tensorrt_llm" model with the provided
[python client script](./inflight_batcher_llm/client/inflight_batcher_llm_client.py)
as following:

```bash
python3 inflight_batcher_llm/client/inflight_batcher_llm_client.py --request-output-len 200 --tokenizer-dir /workspace/tensorrtllm_backend/tensorrt_llm/examples/gpt/gpt2
```

The result should be similar to the following:

```

```

#### Early stopping
You can also stop the generation process early by using the `--stop-after-ms`
option to send a stop request after a few milliseconds:

```bash
python inflight_batcher_llm/client/inflight_batcher_llm_client.py --stop-after-ms 200 --request-output-len 200 --tokenizer-dir /workspace/tensorrtllm_backend/tensorrt_llm/examples/gpt/gpt2
```

You will find that the generation process is stopped early and therefore the
number of generated tokens is lower than 200. You can have a look at the
client code to see how early stopping is achieved.

#### Return context logits and/or generation logits
If you want to get context logits and/or generation logits, you need to enable `--gather_context_logits` and/or `--gather_generation_logits` when building the engine (or `--enable gather_all_token_logits` to enable both at the same time). For more setting details about these two flags, please refer to [build.py](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/examples/gpt/build.py) or [gpt_runtime](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docs/source/gpt_runtime.md).

After launching the server, you could get the output of logits by passing the corresponding parameters `--return-context-logits` and/or `--return-generation-logits` in the client scripts (`end_to_end_grpc_client.py` and `inflight_batcher_llm_client.py`). For example:
```bash
python3 inflight_batcher_llm/client/inflight_batcher_llm_client.py --request-output-len 20 --tokenizer-dir /path/to/tokenizer/ \
--return-context-logits \
--return-generation-logits
```

The result should be similar to the following:
```

```

## Triton Metrics
Starting with the 23.11 release of Triton, users can now obtain TRT LLM Batch
Manager [statistics](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docs/source/batch_manager.md#statistics)
by querying the Triton metrics endpoint. This can be accomplished by launching
a Triton server in any of the ways described above (ensuring the build code /
container is 23.11 or later) and querying the server. Upon receiving a
successful response, you can query the metrics endpoint by entering the
following:
```bash
curl localhost:8002/metrics
```
Batch manager statistics are reported by the metrics endpoint in fields that
are prefixed with `nv_trt_llm_`. Your output for these fields should look
similar to the following (assuming your model is an inflight batcher model):
```bash
# HELP nv_trt_llm_request_metrics TRT LLM request metrics
# TYPE nv_trt_llm_request_metrics gauge
nv_trt_llm_request_metrics{model="tensorrt_llm",request_type="context",version="1"} 1
nv_trt_llm_request_metrics{model="tensorrt_llm",request_type="scheduled",version="1"} 1
nv_trt_llm_request_metrics{model="tensorrt_llm",request_type="max",version="1"} 512
nv_trt_llm_request_metrics{model="tensorrt_llm",request_type="active",version="1"} 0
# HELP nv_trt_llm_runtime_memory_metrics TRT LLM runtime memory metrics
# TYPE nv_trt_llm_runtime_memory_metrics gauge
nv_trt_llm_runtime_memory_metrics{memory_type="pinned",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 0
nv_trt_llm_runtime_memory_metrics{memory_type="gpu",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 1610236
nv_trt_llm_runtime_memory_metrics{memory_type="cpu",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 0
# HELP nv_trt_llm_kv_cache_block_metrics TRT LLM KV cache block metrics
# TYPE nv_trt_llm_kv_cache_block_metrics gauge
nv_trt_llm_kv_cache_block_metrics{kv_cache_block_type="tokens_per",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 64
nv_trt_llm_kv_cache_block_metrics{kv_cache_block_type="used",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 1
nv_trt_llm_kv_cache_block_metrics{kv_cache_block_type="free",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 6239
nv_trt_llm_kv_cache_block_metrics{kv_cache_block_type="max",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 6239
# HELP nv_trt_llm_inflight_batcher_metrics TRT LLM inflight_batcher-specific metrics
# TYPE nv_trt_llm_inflight_batcher_metrics gauge
nv_trt_llm_inflight_batcher_metrics{inflight_batcher_specific_metric="micro_batch_id",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 0
nv_trt_llm_inflight_batcher_metrics{inflight_batcher_specific_metric="generation_requests",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 0
nv_trt_llm_inflight_batcher_metrics{inflight_batcher_specific_metric="total_context_tokens",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 0
# HELP nv_trt_llm_general_metrics General TRT LLM metrics
# TYPE nv_trt_llm_general_metrics gauge
nv_trt_llm_general_metrics{general_type="iteration_counter",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 0
nv_trt_llm_general_metrics{general_type="timestamp",model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 1700074049
```
If, instead, you launched a V1 model, your output will look similar to the
output above except the inflight batcher related fields will be replaced
with something similar to the following:
```bash
# HELP nv_trt_llm_v1_metrics TRT LLM v1-specific metrics
# TYPE nv_trt_llm_v1_metrics gauge
nv_trt_llm_v1_metrics{model="tensorrt_llm",v1_specific_metric="total_generation_tokens",version="1"} 20
nv_trt_llm_v1_metrics{model="tensorrt_llm",v1_specific_metric="empty_generation_slots",version="1"} 0
nv_trt_llm_v1_metrics{model="tensorrt_llm",v1_specific_metric="total_context_tokens",version="1"} 5
```
Please note that versions of Triton prior to the 23.12 release do not
support base Triton metrics. As such, the following fields will report 0:
```bash
# HELP nv_inference_request_success Number of successful inference requests, all batch sizes
# TYPE nv_inference_request_success counter
nv_inference_request_success{model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 0
# HELP nv_inference_request_failure Number of failed inference requests, all batch sizes
# TYPE nv_inference_request_failure counter

# HELP nv_inference_pending_request_count Instantaneous number of pending requests awaiting execution per-model.
# TYPE nv_inference_pending_request_count gauge
nv_inference_pending_request_count{model="tensorrt_llm",version="1"} 0
```
